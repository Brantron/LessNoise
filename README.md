## Synopsis

Less Noise is a project designed to clean up diffs. To use it, simply refresh when reviewing a diff to remove the whitespace and look at the meat of the diff.

## Motivation

This project came from a discussion with a Sr. Engineer in which I wanted a sanity check on a PR. The files I was editing were improperly indented so on save, my text editor converted the file to meet our whitespace standards. I shared the link and he let me know I could append a whitespace parameter to the link to get rid of all of the fluff and review the actual changes. My first thought was how cool it would be if that could be automated....

Get to the meat!

## Installation

## Contributors

Feel free to open a PR and start some dialogue! The first thing that comes to mine is whitelisting the appropriate URL's in other services like BitBucket and Bitlab, etc along with the appropriate logic to ensure the matching parameters are appended.
